CSV files are raw data sheets to import into the necessary R files. 

1. Lethal effects -> LD50.1 contains  code for the mortality curves produced by this analysis
LD50.2 contains additional statistical tests run on the models

2. Sublethal Effects -> Micrcolony timeseries contains brood inspection analysis and pollen consumption analysis 
Microcolony_dissection contains dissection analysis
